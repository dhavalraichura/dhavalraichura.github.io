                        <p>Starting from my childhood, I always had a knack for 'Macro Physics' which carried on to my college days where I chose 
                            to go for Mechanical Engineering from Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering. However it is just not possible for the 
                            conventional study system to provide the best knowledge in the field as it is too outdated. I further decided to become a part of the 
                            DJSRacing team which I could say was one of the best decisions in my life.
                            Here I learned how to manage time , learnt multiple new softwares , and understood so many pbasic principles practically.
                            Joining as a 'Motors Member', I tried to soak as much of the knowledge as possible. As i believe "No knowledge is ever wasted" , i always 
                            tried to understand multiple things. After a year I was provided with the opportunity to be a 'DriveTrain Lead' for my team. Here I had to apply
                            both- The knowledge i learnt by being a Mechancial student for 3 years and the self-taught knowledge about Motors.However, the most important 
                            thing I did was the knowledge transfer to my juniors as I understand that repetition limits growth.
