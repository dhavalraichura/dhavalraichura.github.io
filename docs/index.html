                            This is a command line application I have developed to practically apply the python skills I learned from the Online Platforms like Coursera, Youtube etc.
                            The main objective of this project was to clear the basics of developing a menu-driven program and to have a project with a very high functionality ceiling 
                            as to which functions can be included.

                            The website that I have created is completely coded in HTML and CSS. The objective of this project was to understand the basics of frontend development of 
                            websites. While this has been an amazing outlet for my creativity and the learning process has been nothing short of truly inspirational , I would like to 
                            further work on it and improve certain aspects such as (include JavaScript frameworks for a much more interactive experience).

                            Being a part of a team that produces something tangible has imbibed in me the skills of leading a team to a specific tangible goal.
                            The objective of taking up this project was to improve on both technical as well as non-technical skills. Being the DriveTrain Lead for the year 2020-2021 
                            was quite tough at times but also thrilling to work towards something that was not only new but would also revolutionize the way we think about transportation.
