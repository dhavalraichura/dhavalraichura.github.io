                        <p>I am the Ex-DriveTrain Lead of DJSRacing , and a Mechanical Engineer. I am quite keen about E-Sports and E-vehicles alike.
                            My BE Project was to build a ThermoAcoustic Refrigerator and the Deformation Simulation is shown above.
                            The Simulation was done on ANSYS 19.
                            I learned C, C++, HTML, Python by myself as I am especially interested in software design and automation.
                            All my projects posted on GitHub and this website have been made by me using code only. I aim to learn about Machine
                            Learning and work in a growth friendly enviornment. I aspire to build a future that is fully automized 
                            thus improving the quality of life overall. While all these goals seem too much to achieve in a single lifetime , 
                            I strongly believe that , aiming for the Moon guarantees the probability of atleast landing on a star.
