                        <p>As a child I was always told to excel in any field irrespective of the popularity of the field.
                            So I did , in the second home that was school. I made quite a lot of memories but and developed the learning 
                            mindset. I participated in a Hindi Debate , was the highest scorer in certain subjects in the school , participated in
                            the 'Rajya Bhasha' , 'Rashtra Bhasha' and the 'Dr. Homi Bhabha' competitive exams. They all helped me develop the thought
                            process to solve problems by analysis , visualisation and critical thinking.However I am a true believer that 
                            there is no correct place or time to learn , only the mindset. So taking forward my memories and this 
                            thought process , I aim to achieve as much as possible.
