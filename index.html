                                <p>School is our second home as children and the
                                    general notion is that it is the best time to
                                    start creating a personlity for children. We learn 
                                    to socialize among other things that help us become
                                    a better human being.I tried using my time in school
                                    achieve the same goal.
                                </p>

                                <p>After joining college most people get involved in 
                                    completing their assignments or partying , learning
                                    little to no skills in the process that will actually
                                    help them in the long run. I used the opportunity and 
                                    the time to get some hands-on experience on automobiles.

                                <p>An empty mind is the devils workshop.
                                    I believe that extracurricular activities are the best to 
                                    help a man develop his overall personality and time management skills.
                                    It helps develop a great work-life balance and keeps the person fnctioning
                                    at maximum efficiency.
