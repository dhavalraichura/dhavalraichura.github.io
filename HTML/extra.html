                        <p>As the widely known saying goes 'An empty mind is the devil's workshop' , rather than giving the devil another rent-free space to live in 
                            I decided to take up drawing as my hobby which later helped me in my Mechanical Engineering. I passed the Elementary Grade Drawing Exam.
                            I also was a student of Shotokan Karate where I rose to the purple obi(belt). It helped me maintain a fit lifestyle which is really important
                            for the optimal functioning of the brain. While in college I particcipated in DJSRacing which helped me learn a lot of important things,
                            I also participate in the DJSSkylark Workshop where we learnt to build a basic remote control aircraft , learning the basics of 
                            aeroplanes during the process. I aim for this process to never stop as it is very valuable according to me and should never stop
                            as it helps to break the monotony.
